Flipping Digits by Chris Garbers
--------------------------------

This is is flipclock like component I used in my Steam Radio App for iOS. 

I thought maybe someone else can use it somewhere else, so I license this for free, 
be it for commercial or private use. 

Feel free to modify, branch, improve, scrap or scream out loud about it. Did I say "free"?
Yes. Free. 

Thanks
